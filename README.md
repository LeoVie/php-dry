# php-dry â€“ Clone Detection for PHP

php-dry detects duplicated behaviour in your application, even if the duplicated passages are implemented completely
different to each other. Likely you should read a bit about the [theoretical background](documentation/theoretical_background.md)
for a better understanding.

## Run via Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker run -v {path_to_project}:/project leovie/php-dry -h
```

## Run via binary

composer require --dev leovie/php-dry
```

After installation, you can run php-dry via

```
